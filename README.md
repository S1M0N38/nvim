# My Neovim Configuration 
This configuration is heavily based on
[Neovim from Scratch](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ).
After watching the first 10 videos of the playlist you should have a pretty good
understanding of how this configuration works. To understand my thought process
and the reasoning behind my decision, take a took at commit messages:
`git log --reverse`.
