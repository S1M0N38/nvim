# My Neovim Configuration 
This configuration is heavily based on
[Neovim from Scratch](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ).
After watching the first 10 videos of the playlist you should have a pretty good
understanding of how this configuration works. To understand my thought process
and the reasoning behind my decision, take a took at commit messages:
`git log --reverse`.

## Requirements
- Neovim ≥ 0.8
- go ≥ 1.18.4
- tectonic ≥ 0.9.0
- Skim ≥ 1.6.11

## Features
- Tree-like and fuzzy finder prjoject navigation
- Autocompletions (with snippets)
- Language Server Protocol
- Tree-sitter
- LaTeX support (lsp, build, forward/backward search)

## Roadmap
- Plugin lazy load
